  abstract={With the growing spatial resolution of satellite images, high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery scene classification has become a challenging task due to the highly complex geometrical structures and spatial patterns in HSR imagery. The key issue in scene classification is how to understand the semantic content of the images effectively, and researchers have been looking for ways to improve the process. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have achieved amazing results in natural image classification, were introduced for remote sensing image scene classification. Most of the researches to date have improved the final classification accuracy by merging the features of CNNs. However, the entire models become relatively complex and cannot extract more effective features. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a lightweight and effective CNN which is capable of maintaining high accuracy. We use MobileNet V2 as a base network and introduce the dilated convolution and channel attention to extract discriminative features. To improve the performance of the CNN further, we also propose a multidilation pooling module to extract multiscale features. Experiments are performed on six datasets, and the results verify that our method can achieve higher accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.},
