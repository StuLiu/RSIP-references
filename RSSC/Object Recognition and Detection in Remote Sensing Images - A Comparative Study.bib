abstract={In this paper, we have provided a brief literature survey of object recognition & detection in remote sensing. These scene recognition images have more components and more challenging issues in the range of aerial image resolutions. It also shows a critical act as a limited area based on functions. The object detection in optical remote sensing has the best critical part of over supposing conditions of characteristic against affecting a model inputs. Certain moving characteristic act as a set of quality to define a based on personal action. This paper provides a brief summary of different object detection in remote sensing images and also discuss about their strength and limitation. The main focus of this review paper is on the satellite image. A subsists in patent of scene recognition of current model act on a freshly process. Inter relates to the land uses analysis system, other model analysis process as well as turn to the appropriate function. We have also discussed the problems and advancement of current scenario and give three research directions for deep learning for medical image recognition, image classification, and health care. We ensure this review article will provide adequate directions and scope for the betterment of the research community in the field of object recognition & detection in remote sensing.},
